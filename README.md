# Super Mario Maker 2 Jam Website
This repo is for a web based front end for a SMM2 level design contest.  Figuring out wtf I'm doing is an ongoing process that went through several phases:
1. Hand coding html and css for each element
2. Writing Java to generate those files
3. Using Handlebars + javascript for templating. 

The completed website will contain html and css for the following:  
 
1. Navigation Banner 
2. Level Submission Form  
3. Screener Panel 
4. Judging Panel 
5. Main Page
